# Active Context: repo2txt

## Current State
The repository has been successfully forked from donoceidon/repo2txt and cloned locally. A comprehensive GUI implementation plan has been created and reviewed, with detailed suggestions for improvements and considerations.

## Recent Changes
1. Created fork at tylerbcrawford/repo2txt
2. Cloned repository locally
3. Initialized Memory Bank documentation
4. Created detailed GUI implementation plan (gui_implementation_plan.md)
5. Added implementation review with improvements (gui_implementation_review.md)

## Current Focus
Planning and refining GUI implementation strategy with focus on:
- Core functionality (file selection, output configuration)
- New features (clipboard integration, token counting)
- Performance optimizations
- User experience improvements
- Risk mitigation strategies

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Review and prioritize suggested improvements from implementation review:
   - Core Framework implementation
   - Essential Features development
   - Performance optimizations
   - Additional features integration

2. Begin implementation following prioritized order:
   - Set up development environment
   - Create basic GUI framework
   - Implement core features
   - Add performance optimizations

## Active Tasks
- [ ] Finalize implementation priorities
- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Create modular structure
- [ ] Implement core features
- [ ] Add performance optimizations
- [ ] Develop testing strategy
